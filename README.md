## What is OSSM?

OSSM is a free program for managing your Scout Group. It is meant to be a (nearly) all-in-one solution that will give volunteers access to the required data when they need it, as well as helping to cut down on tedious admin work. OSSM is browser-based and has been designed with both desktops and mobile devices in mind, so can be accessed from anywhere. It is also self-hosted, which gives groups full control over the data they collect.

## What isn't OSSM?

Due to it's self-hosted nature, **OSSM is not set up or managed for you!** That's what makes it free*. You will need a server to host your own instance of the OSSM app. You will also need someone with good IT knowledge to be your OSSM admin. If you don't feel comfortable doing this, then OSSM probably isn't the right solution for you.

*= You will need to pay for a domain, and possibly hosting for your OSSM app. OSSM itself is completely free though.
